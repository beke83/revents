Redux (State Management)
Predictable state Cointainer for javascript apps. this allows to store app state centrally.

Pure fuctions
  * Given the same input, will always return the same output
  * Produces no side effects

Reducers specifies how the app state changes in respone to action sent to the store

Setting up Redu
 * Configure the store
 * create a root Reducers
 * Add the store to he index.js file

** Redux can store either simple plain objects or arrays
** when we want to update our store state we dispatch an action
** Actions are plain object

*  To create our store
 - we use the createStore function from redux
 - we return the createStore method along with 'tetReducer' as a parameter

* How to tell react app about the react store
 -in the index,js file we wrap our entire application with the provider we get from redux

 ** Reducers stroe a slice of the store itself
 ** 'dispatch: dispatches or sends an action

** Redux Thunk acts s a middleware that we add to our store and the middleware allows to use the store dispatch inside our action creators
